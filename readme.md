*MusicBeeTheme is a theme for MusicBee player*

 - Enjoy

That's it, the installation is complete!

## How can I help?
**If you enjoy using the theme, please give it a â˜…**

Should you encounter bugs or if you have feature requests, head on over to the [GitHub repo][repo] to open an issue if one doesn't already exist.

Pull requests are also very welcome, since I can't always get around to fixing all bugs myself. This is a personal passion project, so my time is limited.


## Conclusion
Initially, I did this theme theme for myself and as an experiment and did not really count on any result, but now I hope that I have enough time and energy to support and develop it.

Thank you for installing and have a nice day!
